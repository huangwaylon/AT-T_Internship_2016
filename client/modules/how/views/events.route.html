<div>
  This will be the main page to show all the events. This can be done in a list view, or a calendar like view, or simply have it sorted by time.
  We can choose to use cards, or have them select it from a calendar. For certain groups like admins, they should have additional functionality when selecting an event to edit.
  This would most likely go to a separate page, one that I will create later once we finalize.
