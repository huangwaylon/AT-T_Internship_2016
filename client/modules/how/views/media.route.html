  This one will be a page for all the different press and pictures that they have had coverage on.
  One thing we can do here is find a photo gallery plugin to display all the pictures next to each other, and on hover will display
  additional information about that press or picture. For the pictures, we can just funnel them through an ng-repeat, or have them
  go through a directive, and display it that way.
