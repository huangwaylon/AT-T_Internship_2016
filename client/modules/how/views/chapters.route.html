    This is the chapters page which will display the current chapters. We can do this via a list format, and include a map view as well if we want to get fancy, like in the previous website. Information will be pulled from MongoDB. Clicking on a chapter will either open up a modal with the necessary information, or we can contain the information on the page itself, and display it dynamically depending on what they selected.

    Todo: Click on markers for more information (modal or gmaps info box?), make alternate list view, search within x miles of zip code and display chapters.

    Bugs: 
    <ul>
    <li> Markers don't show on second load of map. Fix by checking for empty chapters array when drawing, defer until load done? Doesn't even call getChapters? </li>
    </ul>
