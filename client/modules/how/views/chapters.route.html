    This is the chapters page which will display the current chapters. We can do this via a list format, and include a map view as well if we want to get fancy, like in the previous website. Information will be pulled from MongoDB. Clicking on a chapter will either open up a modal with the necessary information, or we can contain the information on the page itself, and display it dynamically depending on what they selected.

    Todo: Search within x miles of zip code and display chapters, CSS. Link from chapter infowindow/list item to that chapter's events page?
