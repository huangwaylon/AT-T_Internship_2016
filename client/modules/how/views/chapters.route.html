<div>
  This is the chapters page which will display the current chapters. We can do this via a list format, and include a map view as well
  if we want to get fancy, like in the previous website. Information will be pulled from MongoDB. Clicking on a chapter will either open up
  a modal with the necessary information, or we can contain the information on the page itself, and display it dynamically depending
  on what they selected.
