<div>
  This is the inventory page. What needs to be done here is for the inventory stored within the
  database to be displayed in a readable format. A simple table or list can be a good idea here.
  One thing that needs to be considered is that only admins or managers should have access to this tab. It should
  be displayed only when the person logged in is part of that group.
